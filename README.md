## Lab Description
The main objective of this lab is to build a solid understanding of fundamental JavaScript concepts and how to apply them in practice. Students will develop skills in working with variables, strings, and dates, writing and using functions, and manipulating core data structures such as arrays and objects. By completing the tasks and testing code in the browser’s developer console, students will gain hands-on experience writing dynamic and efficient JavaScript programs.
